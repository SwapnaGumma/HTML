**ScrollingFootball**
This project demonstrates a simple HTML page featuring a bouncing football animation using the <marquee> tag. The football image moves in both horizontal and vertical directions, creating a dynamic effect.

**Features**
The football moves alternately from left to right.
The football also moves up and down within a defined height.
Uses <marquee> to create a bouncing animation effect.
**How It Works**
The outer <marquee> moves the image horizontally from right to left.
The inner <marquee> moves the image vertically within a height of 800px.
The scrollamount="30" property controls the speed of movement
